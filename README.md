# Early-Diabetes-Prediction-DataMining

## Overview 
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals of Pima Indian heritage based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

## Dataset Description

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set
The dataset comprises the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Binary class variable (0 or 1) indicating the presence or absence of diabetes

## Data Preprocessing
The data underwent normalization to ensure consistent scaling across features. This preprocessing step is crucial for the effectiveness of various data mining techniques.

## Data Mining Techniques
The project utilizes a variety of data mining techniques for early diabetes prediction:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Naive Bayes
Neural Network Architectures:
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier

## Usage 
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
